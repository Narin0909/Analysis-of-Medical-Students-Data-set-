## Using Pivot Tables I displayed the following:
### Average Values for the following male and females (Age, BMI, Temperature, Heart Rate, Blood Pressure and Cholestrol).

### Average height and weight for genders are 174.94 and 174.97 for male and female height and 69.98 and 69.6 for weight in males and females meaning that both gender's height and weight have a great relationship.
